<h3>Heidi Probst</h3>
<p>(image: Heidi-Probst.jpg alt: Heidi Probst class: pull-right thumbnail photo)<strong>Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>Completed her PhD in 2002 ; a randomised controlled trial (n=360) investigating radiotherapy for breast cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Current role</strong></p>
<p>Reader in Radiotherapy at Sheffield Hallam University where she has worked as a lecturer and researcher since 2001.</p>

<p>At Sheffield Hallam University Heidi teaches breast cancer radiotherapy, research methods and supervise MSc and doctoral students. She is also a research team leader for the Radiotherapy and Oncology team. Her research interests are in radiotherapy for breast cancer (currently PI for a study developing a breast immobilization devise for women undergoing breast irradiation with an intact breast), the radiotherapy workforce (particularly burnout or compassion fatigue and the development of professional resilience) and e-learning and smartphone technology (recently developed a smartphone app with the company MyKnowledgeMap for the development of research skills in Allied Health Professionals)</p>
<p>In 2011 Heidi was awarded a Fellowship from the College of Radiographers (CoR) for contribution to the science of radiography.</p>
